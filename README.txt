Description:
This repository contains two main files, `Solutions_Notebook.ipynb` and `R_supplementary.Rmd`, 
that provide solutions to problems related to statistical fundamentals, linear regression and full Bayesian inference. 
`Solutions_Notebook.ipynb` contains the full solution of both the mathematical proofs and the coding problems 
with rigorous explanation and documentation, while `R_supplementary.Rmd` contains only the code and documentation 
in R to solve the coding problems in `Solutions_Notebook.ipynb`.

Usage:
If you plan to run only the python jupyter notebook: `Solutions_Notebook.ipynb` it is standalone and provides everything. However if you prefer R
you should run `R_supplementary.Rmd` written in R markdownm while also having open `Solutions_Notebook.ipynb` for the problem formulation,
in depth discussion and solution explations it provides.
